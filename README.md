# 👋 Hi, I'm Soumik Chatterjee

Python Developer with 8+ years of experience across corporate, EdTech, and entrepreneurial domains. I started my journey as a Software Engineering Analyst at Accenture, worked on enterprise test automation and data workflows for major financial clients, and later transitioned into the EdTech space during the pandemic. Today, I’m building smart tools and platforms to make tech education globally accessible and affordable.
